# Introduction 

This database system is created to be both optimal and easy to use.
The behaviour is similar to a lua table with they key difference that it stores 
the data stored inside it. 

not all data is cached on database object request it will only be cached 
when requested. 

## Limitations 

- No access outside the certain resource and / or server 

## Features 

The system provides useful features, such as determining data length and supporting table methods like table.insert and table.remove.
When a table is rewritten, the old values are systematically deleted from the KVP storage, maintaining data integrity.
